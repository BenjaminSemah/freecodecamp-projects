          This page is a compilation of ten online resources that I have found helpful in my journey as a developer. And I’ll explain why you should also consider using them too.
        </p>
        <p>
          They include developer communities, podcasts, books, and more. And all of these resources are beginner friendly.

      <section class="main-section" id="FreeCodeCamp">
        <header>FreeCodeCamp</header>
        <p>
          FreeCodeCamp is one of the popular coding websites on the internet. The curriculum is well-structured and beginner friendly. Many boot camps incorporate FreeCodeCamp lessons into their curriculum. The FreeCodeCamp community is also one of the most vibrant community of programmers online.
        </p>
        <p>
          FreeCodeCamp is a whole package and includes the following.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>The FreeCodeCamp Website (learning platform)</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="CodeNewbie_Podcast">
        <header>CodeNewbie Podcast</header>
        <p>
          When I started learning to code, I often googled “podcast recommendations for new programmers”. One that caught my attention always was The CodeNewbie Podcast. It appeared either at the top or close to the top of all the search results I clicked on. I decided to check it out. And it sure did live up to the hype.
        </p>
        <p>
          One thing I love about The CodeNewbie Podcast is the diverse backgrounds of the guests. There’ve been people on the podcast who are;
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Computer Science graduates</li>
          <li>Musicians</li>
          <li>Truck drivers</li>
          <li>Stay-at-home moms</li>
          <li>And more</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Saron Yitbarek, the host, talks to these amazing people “on their coding journey in hopes of helping you on yours”. If you’re a code newbie, check out the CodeNewbie Podcast.

      <section class="main-section" id="Get_A_Dev_Job">
        <header>Get A Dev Job</header>
        <p>
          The title of the book is “How to Learn to Code and Get a Developer Job”. It’s written by Quincy Larson, founder of FreeCodeCamp. This book contains practical advice on how to increase your chances of landing your first developer job. Solid advice in there. No fluff or BS.

      <section class="main-section" id="Build_A_Portfolio">
        <header>Build A Portfolio</header>
        <p>
          This short e-book by Josh Comeau shows you the ropes of building a dev portfolio that is appealing to both recruiters and other developers. If you’re yet to land your first job as a developer, at some point it would be useful for you to have a personal website or portfolio. A place where you have some of your projects on display.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="Hashnode">
        <header>Hashnode</header>
        <p>
          “Hashnode is everything you need to start blogging as a developer.” If you’re a tech writer, looking for a supportive community of like-minded fellows, Hashnode is the place to be.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="NoCSDegree">
        <header>NoCSDegree</header>
        <p>If you’re working on breaking into tech and you don’t have a Computer Science degree, you should check out the NoCSDegree website. As the name suggests, this is a website that features stories of people who started their tech careers with no Computer Science (CS) degree.
        </p>
        <p>
          You probably know already that you don’t need a CS degree to land a job in tech. But it still helps if someone points to people who have done it. That’s what Pete, who runs NoCSDegree does with these articles. The interview-style articles are often short and can be read in about five minutes.

      <section class="main-section" id="First_Timers_Only">
        <header>First Timers Only</header>
        <p>First Timers Only
Contributing to open source for the first time can be scary and a little overwhelming. Perhaps you’re a Code Newbie or maybe you’ve been coding for a while but haven’t found a project you felt comfortable contributing to. First Timers Only will teach you how to contribute to open-source projects.
        </p>
  
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="PRAMP">
        <header>PRAMP</header>
        <p>
          PRAMP is a website that pairs you with other developers. You take turns as a pair to act as interviewer and interviewee. PRAMP provides the questions that you would use for the mock interviews - both technical and behavioral interviews.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section class="main-section" id="MDN_Docs">
        <header>MDN Docs</header>
        <p>
          The MDN Docs include documentation for web technologies including the following.
        </p>
        <div id="code-container">
          <code>HTML</code>
          <code>CSS</code>
          <code>JavaScript</code>
          <code>Python</code>
          <code>Accessibility</code>
        </div>
        <p>
          I use this website as a reference source. When I need to look up more information about a particular topic, it's one of the first places I go to.
        </p>
        <p>
          There’s an IDE on the website that you can use to write and run example code. This is useful because as you read the documentation, your can practice or play around with the code to get a better understanding of the topic you’re reading about. This is one of those websites you should bookmark and visit often.
